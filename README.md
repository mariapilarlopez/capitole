# Capitole 
Implementation based on "TestSqlDao (3).java"

## What have I done?
- Rename some methods to make it clearer what they do. 
- Set up a framework to delegate the database connection and SQL execution.
- Modify SQL statements to adapt them to what they must do.
- Implement some test to verify functionality.
- Create REST API to interact with the application (CRUD)
- Generate documention of the REST API. 

## What have I used?
Springboot, MyBatis, Swagger, Junit, Java11

## Execution

mvn spring-boot:run
